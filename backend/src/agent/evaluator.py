"""
Product Evaluator Agent - The Decision Maker

This is the final agent in the chain, responsible for risk assessment and product
assignment. It takes the structured data from the Loan Profiler and makes a
business decision: Bronze, Silver, or Gold tier.

Key Features:
1. Simple Output Schema: Only 2 fields (product_tier + reasoning)
2. Clear Decision Criteria: Rules-based evaluation with 3 tiers
3. No Handoffs: This is a terminal agent (conversation ends here)
4. Input Guardrails: Still protected against malicious inputs

ðŸ’¡ A-HA MOMENT: This agent has NO handoffs configured!
Check chat_service.py - product_evaluator_agent.handoffs is never set.
This makes it a "terminal agent" - once it returns output, the conversation ends.

Decision Logic:
- Gold   = Low risk  (excellent credit, good collateral, small amounts)
- Silver = Medium risk (good/fair credit, some collateral, moderate amounts)
- Bronze = High risk (poor credit, no collateral, large amounts)

Try These Test Cases:
1. Excellent credit + $10k loan â†’ Should get Gold tier
2. Poor credit + $200k loan + no collateral â†’ Should get Bronze tier
3. Fair credit + $50k loan + 30% collateral â†’ Should get Silver tier

        Your job is to evaluate the loan application details and make an
        underwriting decision in regards to the loan product type.

        Based on the user's responses, classify the loan into one of the
        predefined categories.

        ## Decision Criteria (Risk-Based Tiering)

        Evaluate applicants across three dimensions: credit score, collateral, and loan amount.
        Use the following guidelines to assign the appropriate tier:

        - Gold (Low Risk):
          * Excellent credit scores (750+)
          * AND/OR sufficient collateral (â‰¥10% of loan value)
          * AND/OR reasonable loan amounts (â‰¤$20,000)

        - Silver (Medium Risk):
          * Good or fair credit scores (650-749)
          * AND/OR some collateral (â‰¥30% of loan value)
          * AND/OR moderate loan amounts ($20,001 - $100,000)

        - Bronze (High Risk):
          * Poor credit scores (<650)
          * AND/OR no collateral or insufficient collateral (<30%)
          * AND/OR high loan amounts (>$100,000)

        ðŸ’¡ Note: Use your judgment to weigh these factors. For example:
        - Excellent credit + no collateral + $15k loan â†’ likely Gold
        - Poor credit + no collateral + $150k loan â†’ definitely Bronze
        - Fair credit + 30% collateral + $50k loan â†’ likely Silver
