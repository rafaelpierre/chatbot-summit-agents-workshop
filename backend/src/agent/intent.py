"""
Intent Agent - The Router of the Multi-Agent System

This agent serves as the entry point and "bouncer" for the loan origination system.
Its job is simple but critical: determine if the user's query is loan-related.

Key Design Decisions:
- Low temperature (0.1): We want deterministic, consistent routing decisions
- Small max_tokens (100): Intent classification shouldn't require long responses
- No output schema: Returns plain text when rejecting non-loan queries
- No input guardrails: This is the first line of defense, so we don't double-check

ðŸ’¡ A-HA MOMENT: Notice this agent does NOT use input_guardrails, even though
it's imported! Only the downstream agents (profiler, evaluator) validate inputs.
This is intentional - we want to quickly route queries before expensive validation.

Try These Test Cases:
1. "I need a loan for a house" â†’ Should hand off to Loan Profiler Agent
2. "What's the weather today?" â†’ Should politely decline
3. "Can you help with credit cards?" â†’ Should politely decline (not loans!)
